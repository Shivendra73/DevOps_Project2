A retail company Abstergo Corp. has recently setup an online shopping portal(website) to sell their products. Due to fierce competition, the company wants a solution that can reduce the time and effort it needs to enhance the functionality of their website on a regular basis. They are looking for an automated way to deploy the new code (for new features) to production website whenever they want.

Business Requirements

    • The team of developers working on new features will merge their code to a GitHub repo.
    • As soon as the code reaches GitHub, using a CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline, setup in Jenkins, automated builds will be triggered.
    • The automated builds will frequently deploy new features to the production website.
    • Every build will prepare a Dockerfile and push docker images to docker-hub.
    • Every docker image will be deployed (Continuous Deployment) to a kubernetes-cluster.
